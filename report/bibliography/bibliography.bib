  abstract={Comets often display narrow dust jets but more diffuse gas comae when their eccentric orbits bring them into the inner solar system and sunlight sublimates the ice on the nucleus. Comets are also understood to have one or more active areas covering only a fraction of the total surface active with sublimating volatile ices. Calculations of the gas and dust distribution from a small active area on a comet's nucleus show that as the gas moves out radially into the vacuum of space it expands tangentially, filling much of the hemisphere centered on the active region. The dust dragged by the gas remains more concentrated over the active area. This explains some puzzling appearances of comets having collimated dust jets but more diffuse gaseous atmospheres. Our test case is 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, the Rosetta mission target comet, whose activity is dominated by a single area covering only 4% of its surface.}

  abstract={While the study of dust–plasma interactions is by no means new, early progress in the field was slow and uneven. It received a major boost in the early 1980s with the Voyager spacecraft observations of peculiar features in the Saturnian ring system (e.g. the `radial spokes') which could not be explained by gravitation alone and led to the development of the gravito-electrodynamic theory of dust dynamics. This theory scored another major success more recently in providing the only possible explanation of collimated high-speed beams of fine dust particles observed to sporadically emanate from Jupiter by the Ulysses and Galileo spacecrafts. These dynamical studies were complimented in the early 1990s by the study of collective processes in dusty plasmas. Not only has this led to the discovery of a whole slew of new wave modes and instabilities with wide ranging consequences for the space environment, it also spurred laboratory studies leading to the observation of several of them, including the very low frequency dust acoustic mode, which can be made strikingly visual by laser light scattering off the dust. The most fascinating new development in dusty plasmas, which occurred about 7 years ago, was the crystallization of dusty plasmas in several laboratories. In these so-called `plasma crystals', micrometre-sized dust, which are either externally introduced or internally grown in the plasma, acquire large negative charges and form Coulomb lattices as was theoretically anticipated for some time. This entirely new material, whose crystalline structure is so strikingly observed by laser light scattering, could be a valuable tool for studying physical processes in condensed matter, such as melting, annealing and lattice defects. Recognizing the crucial role of gravity on the crystal structure, microgravity experiments have already been performed in aircraft, sounding rockets, the Mir Space Station, and most recently in the International Space Station, leading to interesting new phenomena and insights. Dust–plasma interactions are also important in the industrial laboratory. The nuisances and hazards related to dust charging in mills, granaries and mines have been known for a long time. At the same time dust charging has been effectively used in electrostatic precipitation, separation and spraying as well as in the sterilization and electrophoresis of biological materials. Also, plasma processing is now used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. The condensation and transport of fine dust particles in these high-density, low-temperature plasmas leading to product yield loss, is a significant problem facing this multibillion dollar industry, and is expected to become more important as feature sizes decrease in the future. The role of dust–plasma interactions in magnetic fusion devices, where dust could grow in the edge of the fusion plasma discharge itself and be subsequently transported elsewhere, is also beginning to receive attention, lately. I expect this rapid growth will continue well into the foreseeable future. While the richness and complexity of the field, with numerous unresolved and challenging problems, will continue to stimulate the field, several forthcoming space missions (e.g. Cassini and Rosetta) will provide important observational boosts. The fascinating high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope photographs of dusty cosmic regions, such as those where new stellar and planetary formation are taking place in plain sight (the so-called cosmic nurseries), is only now beginning to underscore the importance of dusty plasma phenomena in these vital astrophysical regions. Finally, the proposed International Microgravity Plasma Facility, dedicated to dusty plasma studies in the International Space Station within the next few years, will provide a major boost to this fascinating field.}

  abstract={The hypothesis of an exogenous origin and delivery of biologically important molecules to early Earth presents an alternative route to their terrestrial in situ formation. Dipeptides like Gly-Gly detected in the Murchison meteorite are considered as key molecules in prebiotic chemistry because biofunctional dipeptides present the vital link in the evolutionary transition from prebiotic amino acids to early proteins. However, the processes that could lead to the exogenous abiotic synthesis of dipeptides are unknown. Here, we report the identification of two proteinogenic dipeptides—Gly-Gly and Leu-Ala—formed via electron-irradiation of interstellar model ices followed by annealing the irradiated samples to 300 K. Our results indicate that the radiation-induced, non-enzymatic formation of proteinogenic dipeptides in interstellar ice analogs is facile. Once synthesized and incorporated into the ''building material'' of solar systems, biomolecules at least as complex as dipeptides could have been delivered to habitable planets such as early Earth by meteorites and comets, thus seeding the beginning of life as we know it.}

A large increase in organic material occurred during and after the event, with smaller changes in carbon dioxide relative to water. On approach, the spacecraft observed frequent natural outbursts, a mean radius of 3.0 ± 0.1 kilometers, smooth and rough terrain, scarps, and impact craters.
